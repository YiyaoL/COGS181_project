COGS181 final project winter2023

This problem is adapted from the 2023 EY Open Science Data Challenge. The goal of this study is to build a machine learning model that estimates the rice crop yield for the An Giang province in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, using satellite time series data. 

Rice crop yield data was collected for the period of late 2021 to mid-2022 over the Chau Phu, Chau Thanh, and Thoai Son districts. This region is a dense rice crop region with a mixture of double and triple cropping cycles. When accessing the data, we define the Winter Spring season as 2020/12/01 to 2021/04/30 and the Summer-Autumn season as 2021/04/01 to 2021/08/30.
